Fun page I made to explore the Web Audio API

Here is a link to the Web Audio API docs: https://dvcs.w3.org/hg/audio/raw-file/tip/webaudio/specification.html

I wanted to make a small interactive page that would provide sounds while one typed.
The keys that correspond to musical notes actually trigger the pitches that those notes correspond to.
I work on this for fun and will be adding and tracking additions as I go.
