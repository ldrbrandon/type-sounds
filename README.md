Fun page I made to explore the Web Audio API

Here is a link to the Web Audio API docs: https://dvcs.w3.org/hg/audio/raw-file/tip/webaudio/specification.html

I wanted to make a small interactive page that would provide sounds while one typed.
The keys that correspond to musical notes actually trigger the pitches that those notes correspond to.
I work on this for fun and will be adding and tracking additions as I go.

Updates:
-lower case and upper case "a b c d e f g" all trigger corresponding pitches
-can press keys simultaneously to get sounds at the same time
-added boxes to show the notes that will be triggered
-can also press boxes to trigger the notes
